Dynamic Sustainability

Motivation:
Current modelling approaches to sustainable development do not model all Earth systems comprehensively. While they attempt to address environmental feedbacks between physical and living systems, some of these interactions are evolving, such as greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost, ice sheet melting, forest dieback and more. If they are underestimated, it could mean failure to ever achieving the SDGs.

Objective:
Develop a global system model to analyze and simulate in a socio-economic transformation at the real-world decision-making level.This would include socio-economic feedbacks, e.g. rising inequality, debt, the long-term effects of education and social responses to crisesIt would also include inequality, debt, the long-term effects of education and social responses to crises

Approach:
Neural Network, machine learning neural network. Potential for crowd-sourcing ( data)
